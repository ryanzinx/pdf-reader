how i overcome the obstacles and sur vive in online learning method  
 
 due to the number of corona cases had been increased which was starting at the 
early of the  the government has announced the regulation to restrict public activities 
the restrictions of public activities are implemented  to working and learning from home 
hence it has been two years since the regulation was announced online learning method 
has been underwent by several univers ities likewise the students of other universities i 
also experience online learning method in my college during online learning and teaching 
activities i have encountered several obstacles in the past two semesters however i  am 
able to overcome them in several ways   
 as for the obstacles there are three problems that i have been struggling during 
online learning the first obstacle is i am having a hard time to comprehend the courses 
since every material is delivered online the college does not gi ve the materials in physical 
books or textbooks when the materials are presented online there is only a small piece of 
information that i  receive compared to the information sorted in physical books in 
addition i also cannot take notes and summarize th e materials properly therefore i am not 
able to  fully understand the materials that are presented online  
 the second obstacle that i face in online learning  method  is i hardly grasp the 
materials that are delivered through lectures ’ speeches frequently lectures are likely to 
perform online classes through applications such as google meet and zoom these online 
applications  require a good quality of connection if not the sound and resolution quality of 
the video would be on poor condition f or those reasons i sometimes do not un derstand what the lectures have spoken accordingly online learning method has caused me some 
difficulties in understanding lectures’ speeches  
 the last but not least obstacle in online learning happens when the lec tures ask  the 
class to make group projects usually each of the courses in class has assignments that are 
needed to be done in teamwork after the groups are made each of the group has to present 
the material trough online presentation in the process of  making the group assignment it is 
hard to have a discussion with the classmate this happens because the distance of each 
member’s house is incredibly far thus we are only able to have chitchat and a discussion 
through online messenger oftentimes the  poor connection would be a problem and the 
presence of the members would be the main problem as well consequently there would be 
a delay in finishing the groups’ assignments  
 despite  of many obstacle s i could still survive pass through  the obstacles  with all 
the efforts first thing that i used to do when i got confused  with the materials that lectures 
presented in online meeting is i often ask to my classmate s and tells  them all the 
misunderstand s based on the materials that given by the lectures even though the answer is 
someti mes not really answered all the matters at least  it helps me a little  there are various  
responds when i ask something to my classmate s the person  who wants  to be asked and 
the person  who does not  wants to be asked  but it does not really matters as long i could 
get the answer from the person  who wants to be asked  
 the second thing that i do when i didn’t catch  the lectures ’ materials is i am doing 
research using search engine like  google bing or yahoo i am dig ging all the  information  
from there  such the materials and the assignments it is easier to do es than has to ask to 
classmate s because  just put or type the keyword on the search  bar that i  needed to be 
searche d and all i  have  searched  are clearly  showed there although  i need  to be picky to 
the things that i have search ed there are many kinds of infor mation  and websites  choose 
wisely before click on o ne of them to avoid the miss information and fake websites tha t 
often showed  up whenever i searched through online search engines   the last thing  and the most impactful to help me a lot is youtube  video  sometimes 
i could not comprehend the written materials i got from online search engine or website i 
need something more practical rathe r than  only the written texts thus youtube extremely 
helps me a lo t to understand the materials in youtube there are many videos that explain 
thoroughly the  courses that i needed therefore i am able to master the courses both from 
written and animated slideshows from youtube videos  
 in conclusion throughout these past two semesters  in college  i have faced several 
obstacles wit h online learning method those are having a hard time to understand the 
materials hardly grasping the intended messages on lectures ’ speeches and cooperating 
with my classmates whenever there is a group project nevertheless i could overcome the 
probl ems and survive in several ways whenever i am confused  with the course my 
classmat es alway s got my back helping me with the difficulties  moreover i found it useful 
to search the addition materials from online search engines su ch as google  bing and 
yahoo not only that youtube also plays significant roles in helping me understand the 
materials more clearly and practical  it can be assumed that online learning method is really 
challenging yet i could manage t o handle the obstacles
